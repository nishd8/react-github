# react-github
**Description:**

 - This is a reactJS based project, it utilizes github's api to search and get user data and store it in browser's local storage.
 - Bootstrap is used for styling Font-awesome for Icons and Axios for making endpoint calls.
 - I have tried to name the variables and functions with intent of self-description there may be some slip-ups as it is developed in a single day.

**How to Use:**

 - Fork the repository and install npm and node js
 - `cd github-user-search`
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`
